## Introduction

This is the backend code for the Northwind Dataset. I have used the link that you provided me in order to create this backend.
It was developed usind Node.js Express

## Getting started

Once you clone the code on your machine you can install all of the packages using

    'npm install'

when that is done you can start the server using

    'npm start'

for one time use and

    'npm run server'

which starts it using nodemon. Nodemon restarts the server each time you save.
